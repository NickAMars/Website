<h1> Remember Main </h1>

<p> This sub part of remember which I will insert the style and the html markup,
 The graph is suppose to be a d3.js. I have been think of using it for data visualization because I
 look it up and it look good. I am aware of svg image format. I need to find out how to use d3.js.
 I just need to know how to mix d3.js with react and redux application which I am building.
